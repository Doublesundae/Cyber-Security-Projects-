In the Junior Security Analyst role, you will be a Triage Specialist. You will spend a significant portion of your time triaging or monitoring the event logs and alerts.
<br/>The responsibilities of a Junior Security Analyst or Tier 1 SOC Analyst include the following:

<br/> - Monitor and investigate alerts (most of the time, it's a 24x7 SOC operations environment)
<br/> - Configure and manage security tools
<br/> - Develop and implement IDS signatures
<br/> - Escalate the security incidents to the Tier 2 and Team Lead if needed
<br/>

<br/>
<br/> The Cyber Defense path aims to give a broad introduction to the different areas necessary to detect and respond to threats. This path will be looking at the following areas:

<br/> - Threat and Vulnerability Management
<br/> - Security Operations and Monitoring
<br/> - Threat Emulation
<br/> - Incident Response & Forensics
<br/> - Malware Analysis and Reverse Engineering

<br/> Once you complete this path, you should have the fundamental components of detecting and responding to threats in a corporate environment and using these core concepts to build your understanding of more complex topics within this field.
